We go into the Eclipse Dirigible Web IDE. We will start off by creating an empty project. We click on New in the workspace explorer on the left and from the dropdown menu select Project. In the new project wizard we give our project the name “UniversityProject”. Click next. We can select one of the predefined project templates, but as we will not be needing that, we select Blank application and click Finish. In the left under the workspace explorer you see the basic structure of one Eclipse Dirigible Project. You have the DataStructures, MobileApplications, ScriptingServices and so on.
Right click on the project and under New select Data Structure. We want to crate a Relational Database Table so we select it and click next. The first column of the table will be the id: Click add to add a new column. For the column name type ID, give it an INTEGER type and check the not null and primary key boxes. The second column is the first name of the student. Again, click Add and for the column name type FIRST_NAME, select VARCHAR type, set it’s length to 30 and check the not null box. The third column is the last name of the student. Click Add and for the column name type LAST_NAME, select VARCHAR type, set it's length to 30 and check the not null box. The fourth column is the average grade of the student. Click Add and for the column name type AVERAGE_GRADE, select DOUBLE type and check the not null box. The fifth column is the birthdate of the student. Click Add and for the column name type BIRTH_DATE, select DATE type and check the not null box. Click Next. Then you should name your table. Name the table "students.table". After that click Finish. You will see the table definition. It will be in JSON format. You can publish your project. In the left right click on the name of the project and from the drop-down menu choose Publish. You can open the database view by clicking on the button "other..." which is positioned on the top of the screen. From the pop-up window choose option "Database" and click OK. After that on the bottom of the screen there will be SQL Console window in which we can type sql queries. Type in the console: "SELETCT * FROM STUDENTS" and click on the button "Query" placed on the top of the console. There will be showed no results because you need to create another data structure. Again, in left right click on the name of the project and choose consecutively "New" and "Data structures". Then from the pop-up window choose the last option named "Delimiter Separated Values Sample Data". From available tables choose the table which you just created and add it to your project by clicking Next button. After that, click Finish. You need to publish your project once again by right clicking in left on the name of the project and choosing Publish option from the drop-down menu. After that open again the database view by clicking the button "other..." placed on the top of the screen and choose the first option from the pop-up window named "Database". Finally, write in the SQL Console window placed on the bottom of the screen the query: "SELECT * FROM STUDENTS". Then click the button Query placed on the bottom of the console and see the results on the bottom of the console.
