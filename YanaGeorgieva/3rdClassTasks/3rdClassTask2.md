1. Go to Eclipse Dirigible Web IDE and start off with creating a new empty project.

2. Afterward go to the **File** menu located in the upper left corner and choose New and create yourself a new **Project**. You should also give it a name of your liking.

3. You will be given an option to choose from various project templates, but for our purposes we will need a blank application template. Choose Finish to end the creation of the project.

4. Following go and right-click on the new project and choose **New** from the menu and from the next menu choose **Data Structure**.

5. Now it is time to create the database. You will need to select the **Relative Database Table** template from the menu. Click **Next**. On this step you must add all necessary table properties like naming the table and adding the types of columns it shall have. 

6. First off let us create an example column. Let's assume our table is going to hold the essential data of a university student. It will need to have a column for a faculty number, a name (First and Last), an average grade and a column for the birth date. Now let's see how we will add a column for a faculty number (FN for short). Click the Add button and start filling off the fields:
+ **Name**: ID
+ **Type**: INTEGER
+ Check boxes **Not Null?** and **Primary key?**

_You see we have let some field intentionally black. That is because we won't be needing the faculty number to have a maximum length allowed (it is for **VARCHAR**) and because it is a primary key it won't be needing a default value._

For the rest of the columns fill in:
+ **Name**: FIRST_NAME
+ **Type**: VARCHAR
+ **Length**: 30
+ Check boxes **Not Null?** and **Primary key?**

------

+ **Name**: LAST_NAME
+ **Type**: VARCHAR
+ **Length**: 30
+ Check boxes **Not Null?** and **Primary key?**

------

+ **Name**: AVERAGE_GRADE
+ **Type**: DOUBLE
+ Check boxes **Not Null?** and **Primary key?**

------

+ **Name**: BIRTH_DATE
+ **Type**: DATE
+ Check boxes **Not Null?** and **Primary key?**

7. After filling all the necessary columns for your table, click **Next** and name your table (let the name be STUDENTS for example). Afterward click **Finish**.
_For the curious the table definitions are written in **JSON** format.**

8. Now go again to the name of the project and right-click it and choose from the menu **Publish**. Then you will need to click the button **other..** located in the left top part of the screen near the logo. Choose from its menu **Database**. We have successfully published our database and activated the SQL console so we can have a way to view and manipulate our data. But if we try to retrieve any data we will stumble over a rock. That's because our table is empty and we will need to add some sample data in order to see if we have done a good job at modeling it.

9. So we need sample data. Let's go and create another **Data Structure**. This time from the template menu you shall select **Delimiter Separated Value SAmple Data** and choose **Next**. Now let's find a table with the name **STUDENTS** which holds sample data appropriate for our table and select it. In order to finish click **Next** and **Finish**.

10. Then again we need to publish the updated version of the database and activate the SQL console. Let's try to query it with **SELECT * FROM STUDENTS;**. Et voil√†! This time we succeeded it retrieving data from the table.

_Hope this tutorial has helped you in how to create basic data structures in Eclipse Dirigible!_

_Have a nice day!_ :sunny:
